## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ThreeCountries}
dat <- read.csv(file="data/gapminder.csv", header=TRUE)
head(dat)
summary(dat)
str(dat)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r ThreeCountriesPlots, echo=FALSE}
mycountries <- c("Guatemala", "Honduras", "Netherlands")
three_countries_fun <- function(mycountries) {
  for (w in mycountries) {
    print(w)
    country_name <- subset(dat, dat$country == w)
    plot(country_name$year, country_name$gdpPercap, 
         xlab = "Year", ylab = "GDP", main=w)
  }
}

three_countries_fun(mycountries)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Guatemala's GDP increased exponentially from 1950 to around 1980, peaking at around 5000. It then decreased to less than 4500 in ~1986, before steadily increasing again.
Honduras' GDP increased steadily from 1950 to ~1972, before increasing sharply from ~1972 to 1976, peaking at around 3200. The GDP remains relatively stable until ~2000, increasing again in ~2010.
Netherland's GDP increases steadily over 50 years.
